			<h2>Miro Community in a Nutshell</h2>
			<p>Most organizations don’t have a single outlet for videos, and with Miro Community that’s fine - you get the benefits of exposure on YouTube, iTunes U, and wherever else you publish, without needing to re-host centrally.</p>
			<p>Miro Community gives you leverage: it’s a simple way to manage 10,000+ videos, no matter where they are hosted. You get a branded video portal that: is tailored to you, drives SEO directly to your site, and integrates with your existing web strategy.</p>

			<h2>Background</h2>
			<p>Miro Community began with a focus on building local video communities in a time when local news outlets were shrinking while more and more people and organizations turned to online video to present their grassroots experiences. With a generous grant from the Knight Foundation, the Participatory Culture Foundation set out to give any community a chance to provide a local portal to community video content. Along the way, Miro Community transformed into something much broader - a way for any community or organization to easily manage an ever increasing amount of relevant video and create focused spaces around their topic of interest.</p>
