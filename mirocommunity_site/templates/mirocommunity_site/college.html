		<h1>Your videos represent your school. Use them well.</h1>
		<p> Get your videos on the web, without just sending people to YouTube.  Present your communications, lecture, and courseware videos on your own video website with Miro Community. Whether you are focused on videos for PR and communications, for 
public events and lectures, or for courseware, your videos are a 
representation of your school's reputation and community.  When you offer
 those videos on a YouTube page you are losing the chance to reinforce 
your own community and brand.</p>
		
		<p>Does your college or university rely on iTunes U and YouTube for delivering your videos? The leading educational organizations don't.  We can help you do better. The TED Conference and MIT are two of the world's leading providers
 of educational videos.  It's not a surprise: both have excellent 
internal technology teams and the have used that expertise to build 
their own custom video sites, TED.com and MIT World.  <strong>Why would 
these organizations invest the time and money to build video sites on 
their own websites?</strong>  Because they know that when you send your 
users off to iTunes or YouTube, you are weakening your viewers 
connection to your school and your community.</p>
		
		<p>But most schools don't have the internal capacity to build a 
world-class video website.  Miro Community gives you chance to setup 
your own video presentation site on your own domain name for very little
 cost and no IT expenses (we host the site and keep the software up to 
date).  The service is inexpensive and can be setup very quickly and 
easily. Sign up for a free trial of a premium account <a href="http://mirocommunity.org/signup/">here</a>.</p>
